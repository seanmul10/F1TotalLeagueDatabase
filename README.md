# F1TotalLeagueDatabase
Repo for the Racing League Tools database used for the F1Total divisions.

After cloning for the first time, make sure to set the path your RacingLeagueTools installation expects the themes folder to be.

To this by creating a text file called "themes_path.txt" in the current folder (alongside this readme), then add a single line to it which is your path. For example, "C:\Users\me\Downloads\RacingLeagueTools\user\themes".
